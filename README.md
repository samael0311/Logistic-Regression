# Logistic-Regression
In this logistic regression project, the goal was to predict whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit or not based on various features and historical data. The dataset used for training and testing the model contained information about clients, including age, job type, marital status, education level, housing loan status, and past campaign outcomes.

The first step of the project involved data preprocessing, where missing values were handled, categorical variables were encoded, and feature scaling was applied if needed. Exploratory data analysis was also performed to gain insights into the distribution of variables and their relationships with the target variable.

Next, the logistic regression model was trained using the cleaned and processed data. The objective of logistic regression was to find the best-fitting line that separates the two classes (subscribed and not subscribed) by estimating the probabilities of clients subscribing to a term deposit.

After training the model, it was evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its predictive capabilities. Additionally, a ROC curve and AUC score were used to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances.

The project's success was determined by achieving a high accuracy and a well-balanced trade-off between precision and recall. If the model exhibited good performance, it could be used to make predictions for new clients and assist in decision-making related to marketing strategies and resource allocation for future term deposit campaigns.
